Platformer Game Project - Java Desktop Game

Video Demo:

This game is a work in progress. This is my first platformer game attempt. I used the project to practice the following:
- Player creation
- Collision detection
- Gravity
- Sprites
- Movement Animation
- Camera Scrolling
- Layout/Level creation and connection using Paint. 
- Currently working out bugs with background music and sound FX. 

Future State:
- Enemies
- Collectable "coins" or "bones"
- Multiple character options
- More Levels
