Platformer Game Project - Java Desktop Game

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/_-vuYY2PCfM

This game is a work in progress. This is my first platformer game attempt. I have two dogs; Widget and Tucson. Tucson is the German Shepherd character that is currently being used. Eventually, I will add the option to choose Widget, as well as other "enemies". I used the project to practice the following:

Current State:
- Menu with Help/Instructions
- Player creation
- Player movement and jumping
- Collision detection
- Gravity
- Sprites
- Movement Animation
- Camera Scrolling
- Layout/Level creation and connection using Paint. 
- Currently working out bugs with background music and sound FX. 

Future State:
- Enemies
- Collectable "coins" or "bones"
- Multiple character options
- More Levels
